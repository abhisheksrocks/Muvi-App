# MUVI app

Muvi app is an app in play store, that aims to provide information about all the movies, released or unreleased based on the TMDb database. This repository holds the code base for that app.

## Getting Started

First thing first, if you have no idea about mobile app development or don't know "Flutter" means then let me help you. It is a framework(a kind of a structure, to make a certain rules and provide certain functionalities) written in Dart programming language(you might have heard about programming languages like C, C++, JavaScript, etc, so it is another programming language built by Google) that aims to build hybrid mobile apps(In layman terms, an app that can run both on iOS and Android, from a single program that a developer writes). That is the jist of Flutter.

## Understanding Flutter

Don't worry if you don't know about flutter much, I didn't knew it too at first. One might say, it's kind of similar to JavaScript. Don't worry if you don't know that too, I didn't when I started. But before beginning, I would really recommend you to take a flutter beginner's course(on YouTube or anywhere you like). It will makes things really easy to understand.
